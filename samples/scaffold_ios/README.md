Scaffold Project for iOS
========================

This project is set up as a universal application supporting iPhone (with classic or retina display) and iPad. Features:

* Assets for low- and high-resolution devices are loaded depending on screen size.
* iPad uses graphics of retina iPhone.
* App rotates in all directions.
* App icons and Startup images are correctly set up.
* While Starling is starting up, the background image is displayed in the classic display list.

To find out more about multi-resolution development, and how to add support for Android devices, please visit the [Starling Wiki][1].

**Note:** You will need at least AIR 3.2 to deploy AIR applications on a mobile device. Furthermore, you need a developer certificate and provisioning profiles, both of which can be acquired from Apple when you are a member of the iOS Developer program.
